# CTF_TUWien

In the course _Introduction to Security_ at TUWien, I developed some solutions to CTF challenges. This challenges were related to _System Security_, such as security principles, authentication and control hijacking techniques. Some challenges involved knowledge of _Browser Security_ and _Web Vulnerabilities_. Lastly, some challenges required knowledge related to _Information Flow_ and _Principles of Formal Security Analysis_.
